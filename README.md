# Prediction of bike sharing in Washington DC (Data from 2011 to 2012)

This repository try to explain how Prophet library of R programming could predict time series data well enough. Prophet's package was developed by Facebok data scientists core team that can be used both R and Python. The aim for this package is to predict time series data as a model where this combined with seasonal trends and holidays that admitted in a country, this package is reliable enough where applied in strong-seasonal data.

I predicted the count of bike sharing in the New York for the next few days. The data that used comes from Kaggle and can be downloaded in https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset?select=day.csv. This data contain some regressor parameter such as temperature, humidity and windspeed where the count of bike sharing is depend on these three variables.
